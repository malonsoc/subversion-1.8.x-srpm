This github repo includes tools for building subversion-1.7.3
RPM's. It is based on the Fedora 17 subversion-1.7.2 package, and
includes tweaks merged from Repoforge's older subversion-1.6.x
packages for compilation on multiple versions of RHEL or Fedora.

There is a new component, mod_downtwrite that. This is packaged with
mod_dav_svn, and provides limitations on server-burdensome operations
such as checking out entire repository trees.

The following components are not compatible with older RHEL releases,
such as RHEL 5.

        psvn - No longer compatible with older Emacs or Xemacs.
		Not included in subversion package for old OS.
	subversion-kde - requires KDE4 Required rewrite of
		dependencies for RPM building. subversion-kde is still
		built, but as placeholder.
	SQLite - Modern SQLite or "sqlite-amalgamation" required.  Use
		sqlite-amalgamation tarball as needed.
	perl-devel - Spurious dependency for compilation, does not
		exist on RHEL 5.

The API documentation used to be built as part of subversion-devel.
Fedora separated this out into subversion-api-docs, for good reasons,
so that needs to be built separately.

The bash-completion utility was installed rather oddly: that has been
cleaned up.
